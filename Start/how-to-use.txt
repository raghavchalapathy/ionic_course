How to use these files

You're downloading a finished Ionic 2 project. The following steps allow you to run it:

1) Simply navigate into this folder and run "npm install" to install all required packages
2) Run “npm run ionic:serve“ to build and serve the app (as shown in the course)
3) if you are using latest ionic run npm install --save-dev @ionic/app-scripts@latest
4) Add <script src="build/vendor.js"></script>  to the index.html in order to enable webpackJson to build your project
Steps 3 and 4 needs to be done to port from ionic-2 to inonic-3

You may then work with this project as you do with any other Ionic 2 project.

If you plan to push this app to a simulator or real device: Don't forget to run "ionic platform add PLATFORM" (learn more in the course section about running apps on real devices)
